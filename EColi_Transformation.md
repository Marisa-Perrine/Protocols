# Inputs
* Diluted pure plasmid (RCR and PMZ416B used)
* Competent ecoli cell aliquots (DH10B cells used)
* LB plates with selectable marker (Kan and Amp used)

# Procedure
## Setup
1. Preheat a heat block to 42°C.
2. Fill a container with ice.
3. Label 1.7 mL eppendorf tubes wth sufficient information.
4. Dilute the pure plasmid product if needed (1 ng/µL was used, a 2-3 µL dilution may also be used). 
5. Allow LB plates to come to room temperature while continuing the procedure.
6. Remove the cell aliquots from the -80°C freezer and put directly onto ice.

## Transformation
1. Pipette 3 µL of the diluted plasmid product into the appropriately labeled tube and set on ice.
2. Aliquot 50 µL of competent cells into each tube and mix by _gently_ flicking. 
3. Incubate the tubes on ice for 20 to 30 minutes.
4. Heat shock the cells at 42°C for 40 seconds, then immedately return them to ice.
5. Recover the cells on ice for 2 minutes.
6. Add 250 µL of LB media to the top of each tube. 
7. Shake horizontally at 37°C, 200 rpm for about an hour (tubes should be taped to the bottom of the shaking incubator).
