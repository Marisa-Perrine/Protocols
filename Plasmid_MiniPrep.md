# Lyse
1. Transfer the suspension into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
2. Centrifuge at 10,000 _g_ for 2 minutes at room temperature.
3. Add 250 µL of Solution I (mixed with RNase A). Vortex to mix thoroughly. 
4. Add 250 µL of Solution II. Invert and gently rotate the tube to obtain a clear lysate. Avoid vigorous mixing. 
5. Add 350 µL of Solution III. Immediately invert several times until a white precipitate forms. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 minutes.

# Bind
1. Insert a DNA mini column into a 2 mL collection tube. 
2. Transfer the clear supernatant into the DNA mini column. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate but reuse the collection tube. 

# Wash
1. Add 500 µL of HBC Buffer (diluted with 100% isopropanol). Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate but reuse the collection tube. 
2. Add 700 µL of DNA Wash Buffer (diluted with 100% ethanol). Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate but reuse the collection tube. This step can be completed again for a total of two washes. 
3. Centrifuge the empty DNA mini column at maximum speed for 2 minutes to remove trace ethanol.

# Elute
1. Transfer the DNA mini column into a nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. If the tube has a separate cap on it, make sure to point the cap to the left in the centrifuge.
2. Add 50 µL of Elution Buffer to the DNA mini column. Let sit at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
