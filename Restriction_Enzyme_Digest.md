# Inputs
* Isolated plasmid DNA
* Buffer solution (CutSmart used)
* Restiction enzyme solution(s) (BamHI used)
* 200 µL tubes (PCR tubes)

# Procdeure
1. Add 4 µL of plasmid, 2 µL of CutSmart buffer, and 1 µL of BamHI to a 200 µL tube.
2. Add water to bring the volume up to 20 µL total (13 µL of water in this case).
